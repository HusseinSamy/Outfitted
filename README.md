 Outfitted is a  social networking platform under development that focuses on connecting and inspiring people interested in fashion.
# Technologie stack
* Angular 
* Tailwind CSS
* .Net 6
* MySQL
# Brief about the development 
outfitted is still under development and there is a ton of features to add, what I have managed to do in the past 8 months:
* Created a Design for the most valuable product (MVP) to visualize how the project will be seen before coding. 
* Developed a responsive front end using Angular keeping in mind best practices.
* Designed a normalized database (Using database normalization techniques) using MySQL.
* Had an overview on how I will develop the recommendation system which will be hybrid of Collaborative  based filtering (CF) and Content based filtering (CBF).
* A RESTful API is currently under development and after that I will code the business logic.
# What will be actually on the MVP?
* Users will be able to create accounts and choose a preferred  styles. 
* Users will be able to see a swiping page that will display photos based on what they have chosen as there preferences. 
* Users will be able to save the photos that they have liked for inspiration. 
* Admins will be able to create, read, update, delete photos to the database and adding the relevant tags for each photo (CRUD operations).
